# Gemini Success Plan - GoViral (PostDoctor)

**Objective:** Generate Revenue by Monday, Jan 19, 2026.
**Strategy:** "The Dogfood Launch" + Direct Sales Outreach.

Since we have zero budget for massive ad spend, we will use *our own tool* to market itself, combined with high-intent manual outreach.

## Phase 1: The Weekend Sprint (Jan 15 - Jan 18)

### Thursday (Today): Integration & Deploy
1.  **You:** Gather the keys listed in `GeminiNeeds.md`.
2.  **Me:** Configure the production server (Docker + Nginx + SSL).
3.  **Me:** Run the `ops/deploy-*.sh` scripts to get the site live on the public internet.
4.  **Together:** Verify the "Happy Path": Sign up -> Connect Twitter -> Generate Post -> Schedule Post -> Verify it appears on Twitter.

### Friday: "Dogfooding" Content Seeding
*Goal:* The site cannot look empty. We need to use PostDoctor to build PostDoctor's presence.
1.  **Create "PostDoctor" accounts** on X, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
2.  **Use the AI:** Generate 20-30 pieces of content about "Social Media Growth Hacks", "AI Marketing", and "Solopreneur Tips".
3.  **Schedule:** Set them to auto-post every 4 hours all weekend.
*Benefit:* This proves the tool works and builds immediate "recent activity" for anyone investigating us.

### Saturday: The "Beta" Offer Setup
*Goal:* Create an irresistible offer for early adopters.
1.  **Pricing:** Set a "Founding Member" price. $9/mo (Lifetime 50% off regular $19/mo).
2.  **Landing Page Tweak:** I will add a banner: *"Beta Access: Lock in 50% off for life. Offer ends Monday."*
3.  **Stripe:** Ensure this specific coupon/price ID is active.

### Sunday: The Hit List
*Goal:* Identify 50 high-probability customers.
*Target:* Indie hackers, small SaaS founders, and "Twitter Growth" coaches.
1.  **Scout:** Go to Product Hunt, IndieHackers, and Twitter. Look for people who launched a product recently but have dead social feeds.
2.  **List:** Compile a spreadsheet of 50 names + DMs/Emails.
3.  **The Hook:** Draft a message: *"Hey [Name], saw you launched [Product]. Looks great, but your Twitter feed is a bit quiet. I built a tool that auto-generates and posts content for you. Want a free month to try it?"*

## Phase 2: Launch Day (Monday, Jan 19)

### 08:00 AM: The Cold DM Blast
1.  Send the 50 messages drafted on Sunday.
2.  **Crucial:** Do this manually (or carefully) to avoid spam filters. Personalize the first sentence.

### 10:00 AM: The "Show Off" Post
1.  Post a thread on your personal and the brand account: *"How I built a SaaS in a weekend and automated my entire marketing strategy using it. [Link]"*
2.  Include screenshots of the Dashboard (it looks sexy, it converts).

### 12:00 PM: Product Hunt / Reddit
1.  Post in r/SaaS, r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur.
2.  **Title:** *"I was tired of writing tweets, so I built an AI to do it. Roast my code."* (Developers love to roast, but they also click).
3.  Engage with every single comment.

## Why This Works
1.  **Low Cost:** Costs $0. Just elbow grease.
2.  **High Intent:** You are targeting people who *need* the solution (founders with dead feeds).
3.  **Social Proof:** By using the tool to post, you demonstrate its value implicitly.

**Financial Goal for Monday:**
*   10 Sales @ $9/mo = $90 MRR.
*   It's small, but it validates the engine. From there, we reinvest that $90 into ads.
